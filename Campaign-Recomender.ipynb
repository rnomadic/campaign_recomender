    "1. Required Input Data Specification: [City-specific Artist Ticket Power] table, with primary key being [artist ID] and [city ID] , if possible to be broken down into regions. Plus, any attribute that can hint artistsâ€™ ticketing power in the location would be helpful. e.g. degree of success in recent concert of artist A held in city B, or whether marketing campaigned turned out successful enough to generate significant number of Makes.<br>\n",

    "4. Matrix factorization is one of numerous ways to implement collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is the most popular data mining model for recommendation systems, adopted by Netflix and Amazon. \n",

    "### Basic Idea: \n",
    "Just as its name suggests, matrix factorization is to, obviously, factorize a matrix, i.e. to find out two (or more) matrices such that when you multiply them you will get back the original matrix. <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, from an application point of view, matrix factorization can be used to discover latent features underlying the interactions between two different kinds of entities.<br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recommendation system such as Netflix or MovieLens, there is a group of users and a set of items (movies for the above two systems). Given that each users have rated some items in the system, we would like to predict how the users would rate the items that they have not yet rated, such that we can make recommendations to the users. In this case, all the information we have about the existing ratings can be represented in a matrix. Assume now we have 5 users and 10 items, and ratings are integers ranging from 1 to 5, the matrix may look something like this (a hyphen means that the user has not yet rated the movie): <br> <br>\n",
